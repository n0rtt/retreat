                    We organise a retreat camp in the forests of The
                    Castle-Crowsnest Watershed Natural Area (CCWNA) in southwest
                    Alberta, Canada. The camp allows you to withdraw for two
                    weeks from all the stresses of life in the city and enjoy an
                    intimate connection with nature, meet new people and heal
                    your inner self.

                    We carefully choose the participants of our camp to create
                    balanced and safe social environment where individuals can
                    easily fit in. We strive to provide an uplifting experience
                    for everyone and allow for new experiences and personal
                    growth.
